# ðŸ“Š Orders Loss Analysis

This SQL query analyzes **orders that could not be fulfilled by other suppliers** due to **price increases**, **inventory shortage**, or a combination of both.  

It compares **actual orders** with **product snapshots** (`pas.product_xcart`) at the **order date**, calculates differences in price and inventory, and marks suppliers who could not sell.

## ðŸš€ How it works

1. Selects orders (`orders`) in the chosen period.  
2. Fetches **product snapshots** from `pas.product_xcart` at the **same date** as the order.  
3. Joins **all suppliers** for the product to see who could have sold.  
4. Compares prices and inventory, marking reasons for not selling.  
5. Calculates differences and percentage differences for detailed analysis.
